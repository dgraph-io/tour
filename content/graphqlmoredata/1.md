Dgraph offers advanced capabilities: query aggregation, geo-queries, and string
search. Exploring them requires a larger dataset.

The Dgraph GitHub repository hosts a
[dataset of movies, directors, and actors](https://github.com/dgraph-io/dgraph-benchmarks/blob/main/data/1million.rdf.gz)
containing about one million triples. The tutorial setup already loaded this
dataset into your local Dgraph instance. We keep the dataset to one million
triples to keep load time short; Dgraph handles far larger datasets with ease.

This subset covers roughly 275,195 movies and 63,450 actors drawn from a
[larger collection](https://github.com/dgraph-io/dgraph-benchmarks/blob/main/data/1million.rdf.gz)
of about 230,000 actors and 86,000 movies. The subset is incomplete, so your
favorite movies or actors may be missing.

The schema displayed here generates the GraphQL API for this dataset.
