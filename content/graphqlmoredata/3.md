Congratulations on completing the GraphQL tutorial portion of the Dgraph Tour!

You should now be able to load a schema into Dgraph's GraphQL API and perform
basic queries and mutations on it.

#### Where to go from here

- You can find more in-depth details in Dgraph's
  [GraphQL API Documentation](https://docs.dgraph.io/graphql/).
- See [Deploy and Manage Documentation](https://docs.dgraph.io/admin/) to learn
  how you can run Dgraph in your own environment.
- Take [Dgraph's DQL Tour]({{< relref "intro/1" >}}) to learn
  Dgraph Query Language (DQL), which runs underneath the GraphQL API of Dgraph.
