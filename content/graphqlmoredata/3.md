Congratulations -- you have completed the GraphQL tutorial portion of the Dgraph
Tour! You can now load a schema into Dgraph's GraphQL API and perform queries
and mutations against it.

#### Where to go from here

- Read the [GraphQL API Documentation](https://docs.dgraph.io/graphql/) for
  full details.
- See the [Deploy and Manage Documentation](https://docs.dgraph.io/admin/) to
  run Dgraph in your own environment.
- Take [Dgraph's DQL Tour]({{< relref "intro/1" >}}) to learn Dgraph Query
  Language (DQL), which powers the GraphQL API.
