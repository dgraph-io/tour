Value variables can also be used in filtering and ordering, provided the
enclosing block supplies the correct UIDs.

Here, `ID` holds the UIDs of all directors named Steven, and `average` maps each
of those UIDs to the director's average. Filtering, ordering, and the result of
`val(average)` all evaluate against that UID context to produce each value.

A value variable can be used in place of a UID variable, `uid(<value-variable>)`
evaluates to the UIDs in the map. For example, the `avs` query block could be
written:

```
avs(func: uid(average), orderdesc: val(average)) @filter(ge(val(average), 40)) @normalize {
```
