{{% notice "note" %}} The remaining lessons query the million-triple movie
dataset. If you haven't loaded it yet, run `make seed-movie-dataset` from the
tour repository root. On Windows (or without `make`), use
`docker exec tour-seed make seed-movie-dataset` instead. {{% /notice %}}

You can issue multiple queries in a single request.

For queries labeled `q1, ..., qn`, the JSON result contains a corresponding
answer block for each query. If you label a block with `var`, Dgraph returns no
results for that block.

Multiple queries in a single request run independently.

The visualization here shows the union of the two queries based on `uid`, but
the JSON result contains each query's independent answer.

Query variables are among the most powerful features of DQL. They let one block's
results feed into another, joining the two queries. The next several pages
explore how they work.
