The previous pages covered variables that store UID results. Value variables
store the matched values instead.

Value variables work differently from query variables. Each value variable is a
map from UID to value; you can exploit this map when reading and filtering.
Extract the value with `val(<variable-name>)`.

Within the defining block, the context already identifies the appropriate UID,
so a value variable acts like the corresponding value. In the enclosing block,
the variable represents the full UID-to-value map and must be aggregated.

Aggregations over value variables operate independently of any index -- the query
has already retrieved the values.

`min` and `max` can be applied to `int`, `float`, `string`, `bool`, and `date`
types.
