We've started Dgraph, but first things first: What is a graph and what has that
got to do with databases?

Graphs describe objects and the interconnections among them. Many people have
heard of friendship graphs, or social network graphs, so let’s start there.

We have loaded [Ratel UI](http://localhost:8000) in an iFrame for this lesson
and have had it run a query that finds Michael and traverses his friendships,
their pets, and their friends' connections.

In the resulting graph, circles denote people and pets, and lines denote
connections or labeled relationships among them.

**Can you find Michael and his pet sheep Rammy on the graph?** 

{{% expandable %}}
```
Michael is the blue circle in the middle of the graph.
Rammy the sheep is the pink circle directly connected to Michael.
``` 
{{% /expandable %}}

<!---The graph could be represented as a picture, written down as text or stored in a graph database. -->

Graphs lend themselves so naturally to visualization that you’ll find yourself
thinking in terms of graphs and visualizations of them.

In a graph, the objects (or entities) are called ***nodes*** and the relationships are
called ***edges*** or ***predicates***.

Graphs aren't just for social networks. Other examples include

- Interconnected data, like SQL tables requiring joins
- Advanced search
- Recommendation engines
- Pattern detection
- Networks, like computers, roads, and telecommunications
- Processes, like business and biological processes
- Events and the causality or other links between them
- Structures of firms or markets

These and the many more applications of graphs lead us to graph databases.
