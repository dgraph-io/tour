Dgraph is running. Before we query it, we need to answer two questions: What is
a graph, and why use one as a database?

Friendship graphs and social network graphs offer the clearest introduction.

[Ratel UI](http://localhost:8000) is loaded in an iFrame for this lesson. It
runs a query that finds Michael and traverses his friendships, their pets, and
their friends' connections.

In the resulting graph, circles denote people and pets, and lines denote
connections or labeled relationships among them.

**Can you find Michael and his pet sheep Rammy on the graph?**

```
Michael is the blue circle in the middle of the graph.
Rammy the sheep is the pink circle directly connected to Michael.
``` 
{{% /expandable %}}

<!---The graph could be represented as a picture, written down as text or stored in a graph database. -->

Graphs lend themselves to visualization: once you see one, you begin to
recognize graph structures everywhere.

In a graph, the objects (or entities) are called ***nodes*** and the relationships are
called ***edges*** or ***predicates***.

Graphs apply far beyond social networks. Other examples include

- Interconnected data, like SQL tables requiring joins
- Advanced search
- Recommendation engines
- Pattern detection
- Networks, like computers, roads, and telecommunications
- Processes, like business and biological processes
- Events and the causality or other links between them
- Structures of firms or markets

Applications like these call for graph databases.
