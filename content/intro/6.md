A graph database is a database optimized for storing and querying graphs. When
it comes to relationships, graph databases are much faster than SQL databases.

SQL databases struggle with graph-like data because following edges means joining
tables. As edges multiply, so do joins, and each join forces the database to
load and process more data.

In a graph database, edges are a fundamental structure, so following an edge is a
single lookup -- fast regardless of the dataset's size.

**Dgraph is a graph database.** It stores and queries graph data efficiently, and
it scales from millions of edges on a single machine to massive graphs spread
across a data center.
