Welcome to [Dgraph](https://docs.dgraph.io/).

<!---
Dgraph is a distributed graph database, designed to scale from a single machine to data centers.

Before using Dgraph in your own projects, you’ll need to know about
graph databases and how to query Dgraph.
-->

This tutorial teaches you to write graph queries in Dgraph Query Language ([DQL](https://docs.dgraph.io/dql/)).


Navigate between lessons with the **Back** and **Next** buttons, or with the **Left Arrow** (&#8592;) and **Right Arrow** (&#8594;) keys. Open the table of contents at any time from the menu icon in the bottom-left corner.

For additional detail, see the [reference documentation](https://docs.dgraph.io/).

When you are ready to begin, click **Next**.
