Now that a schema has been loaded, it's time to load some data. 

Press the **run** button again and check that the response panel indicates the data was
loaded successfully.

Don't worry about the syntax for now, it will be explained later.

{{% notice "note" %}}
**Only run this mutation once.** Blank nodes like `_:michael` are temporary
labels — Dgraph assigns a new UID for each one every time you run the
mutation. Running it again will create a second set of nodes (two Michaels,
two Amits, etc.) rather than updating the existing data. If that happens, run
`make restart` to reset the database and restart the tour, then
[click here](/intro/1) to begin this section again.

The [RDF syntax](https://docs.dgraph.io/dql/dql-mutation/#set-block) used on the right is just one of formats that our [clients](https://docs.dgraph.io/clients/), the [Ratel UI](https://docs.dgraph.io/ratel/), and
REST endpoints support for making queries and applying mutations.  [JSON](https://docs.dgraph.io/dql/dql-mutation/#set-block) and [GraphQL](https://docs.dgraph.io/graphql/) can be used as well.  

For example, the following shows the RDF on the right expressed as JSON:
