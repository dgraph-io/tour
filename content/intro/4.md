In the last exercise, you added some data into Dgraph. Adding or removing data
in Dgraph is called a mutation. Dgraph supports two mutation formats:
[RDF (Resource Description Framework) N-Quad](https://www.w3.org/TR/n-quads/)
and JSON (JavaScript Object Notation).

Every node in Dgraph has a unique identifier called a **[UID](https://docs.dgraph.io/dql/dql-schema/#uid-type)**, an unsigned 64-bit integer, which Dgraph
generates automatically when you create new data.

## Blank UID (New Nodes)

When creating new nodes, use a **blank node** — a temporary identifier that
Dgraph replaces with a real UID. The format is an underscore, colon, and a
name:

```
<_:michael> <name> "Michael" .
```

In JSON, use the `"uid"` key:

```
{
  "uid": "_:michael",
  "name": "Michael"
}
```

When you execute a mutation with blank nodes, the response includes a `uids` map
showing which UID was assigned to each blank node:

```
{
  "data": {
    "code": "Success",
    "message": "Done",
    "uids": {
      "michael": "0x2957809"
    }
  }
}
```

This maps the blank node identifiers (`_:alice`, `_:bob`) to the actual UIDs
assigned by Dgraph (`0x1`, `0x2`). You can use these UIDs in subsequent queries
and mutations.

## Explicit UID (Existing Nodes)

To update an existing node, reference its UID directly:

```
<0x4e030f> <somePredicate> "some new data" .
```

In JSON:

```
{
  "uid": "0x4e030f",
  "somePredicate": "some new data"
}
```

To find a node's UID, query for it:

```
{
  MyUser(func: eq(name, "Jack Torrance")) {
    uid
  }
}
```
