You have set up a Dgraph instance and run mutations to edit data. Before
proceeding, consider this question: What is a graph, and what does it have to
do with databases?

Graphs describe objects and the connections between them. Social network graphs,
for example, connect people through known relationships.

Press **Run** on the query to the right. The JSON response represents a social
network graph.

Graphs extend far beyond social networks:

- Interconnected data, like SQL tables requiring joins
- Advanced search
- Recommendation engines
- Networks, such as computer networks, roads, and telecommunications
- Processes, such as business and biological processes
- Events and the causality or other links between them
- Structures of firms or markets
- Modeling of geographic or 3D objects

These applications and many others make graphs a natural fit for databases.
