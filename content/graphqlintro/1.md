Welcome to GraphQL powered by [Dgraph](https://docs.dgraph.io/).

This interactive tutorial teaches you to write GraphQL queries using Dgraph, a
high-performance graph database.

{{% notice "note" %}} To use Dgraph Query Language (DQL, formerly GraphQL+-)
instead, see the [DQL portion of this tour]({{< relref "intro/1" >}}). The
first five sections focus on using Dgraph with GraphQL. {{% /notice %}}

You will run queries and mutations, progressing from your first graph query to
more advanced operations.

For reference material beyond this tutorial, see the
[Dgraph Docs](https://docs.dgraph.io).
