Dgraph is a loosely-typed database at its core and can operate in a NoSQL-like,
schema-less fashion. GraphQL adds a strongly typed API served from the database
core.

Most GraphQL databases layer GraphQL above the database. Since Dgraph 20.03,
Dgraph embeds GraphQL directly in the database core. Because Dgraph was built
around DQL's GraphQL-like syntax, native GraphQL integration was a natural fit.

The GraphQL API is:

- Strongly typed
- Simple to query
- Easy to traverse
- Flexible to iterate on
- Suited for business logic
- Capable of third-party data integration

The GraphQL API endpoint returns results matching the shape of your request.
