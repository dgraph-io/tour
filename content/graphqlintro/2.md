Dgraph generates a complete GraphQL API with CRUD operations from a schema of
types. Once you upload your schema, you can create, read, update, and delete
instances of each type without further coding.

The editable code block below defines the types for this tutorial. Click
**Push** to apply this schema to your local Dgraph instance.

You must complete this step before continuing.
