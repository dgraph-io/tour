Dgraph generates a GraphQL API endpoint complete with CRUD operations after
ingesting a GraphQL schema comprised of types. So, when you upload your schema,
you already get the ability to perform CRUD operations on instances of each type
in your schema, without further coding.

The schema provided in the editable code block below defines the types for this
tutorial. Click **Push** to apply this schema to your local Dgraph instance.

To continue this tour, this step is required.
