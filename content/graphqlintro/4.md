The last exercise added data to Dgraph. Adding or removing data in Dgraph is
called a mutation.

Dgraph's GraphQL API stores every item as a _node_. The previous example added
11 nodes: eight people and three animals. Nodes have properties -- such as
name and age -- and connect to other nodes through edges. The mutations
connected people to their friends and animals to their owners.

Dgraph's GraphQL API identifies nodes in two ways: the `ID` scalar, or any
field with the `@id` directive. Fields with `@id` must be unique across all
nodes of that type. Our examples use the `xid` field, defined in the schema
with `@id`.

When adding a node, you must provide values for fields marked with an
exclamation mark (`!`), because these fields require input. When updating or
deleting a node, reference it using one of the identification methods above.
When creating edges, specifying an identifier links to the existing node;
omitting all identifiers and supplying required fields creates a new node
linked on that edge.

The example mutation adds a new person, "Manish," along with his new pet,
"Diggy," and creates a friendship edge to the existing person "Alice" by
referencing her `xid`.

The `@hasInverse` directive on our schema edges tells the API to track inverse
edges automatically. You need not create the edge from "Diggy" to his owner
"Manish" or the inverse friendship from "Alice" back to "Manish" -- the API
handles both.
