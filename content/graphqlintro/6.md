A graph database stores and queries graphs. For relationship-heavy data, graph
databases far outperform SQL databases.

SQL databases struggle with graph-like data because following edges requires
joining tables -- sometimes large ones. More edges mean more joins and more data
to load and process.

In a graph database, edges are a fundamental structure. Following an edge
requires a single lookup, making edge-based operations fast.

Dgraph stores graph data and queries it quickly. It scales horizontally,
handling heavy transaction loads against large graphs.

Dgraph can store a graph with millions of edges on a single machine, or
distribute massive graphs across an entire data center.
