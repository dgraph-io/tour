Dgraph assigns every node an internal UID. To give nodes your own external
identifiers, store each identifier as a predicate (edge) on the node. Your
application must enforce the uniqueness of these identifiers.

For details, see the [Upserts documentation on external IDs](https://docs.dgraph.io/dql/upserts/#external-ids).
