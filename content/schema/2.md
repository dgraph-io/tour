With the schema in place, you can add data as triples.

Dgraph assigns its own internal IDs to nodes, but you need a way to reference
the same node more than once in your input data. The label `_:company1` serves
this purpose.

These labels are "blank nodes." Each one tells Dgraph to create a node, assign
it an internal ID, and reuse that ID wherever the same label appears.

After the mutation, the label `_:company1` no longer exists in Dgraph. The
result shows the internal ID that Dgraph assigned in its place. You can query
for that ID directly --- remember `func: uid(<uid_number>)`.

Changing the graph stored in Dgraph is called "mutating" the data.

You can also load this example data in JSON format via the clients, cURL, or
Ratel UI.
