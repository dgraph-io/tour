An [earlier lesson](../../basic/3/) showed that Dgraph stores a schema describing
each predicate's type.

Adding data to an existing schema requires no extra steps. Adding data under a
new schema offers two choices:

- Add the data and let Dgraph infer the schema, or
- Define the schema first, then add the data

Root query functions (`func:`) work only on indexed predicates, so you must
define the schema and declare indexes before you can filter at the query root.
Comparison functions inside `@filter` directives, however, work on predicates
even without indexes.

Run this mutation to define data types and add indexes. The `term` index on
`industry`, for example, lets you filter for every company in a given industry.
