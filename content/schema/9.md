`expand(...predicates...)` queries all specified predicates at once, so you do
not have to list each one individually. For example:

```
expand(_all_)
```

returns every edge on every node matched at that level. You can nest `expand`
to retrieve all predicates at the next level as well.

The [Query blocks and variables](/blocksvars/1) section shows how to combine
`expand` with variables to query a specific set of edges.

{{% notice "note" %}} Each node must have a
[Type](https://docs.dgraph.io/dql/dql-schema/#node-types) defined in the
schema for `expand(_all_)` to work. {{% /notice %}}

You can also pass specific types as arguments, for example
`expand(Card, Document)`.
