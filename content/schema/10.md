This concludes the schema module.

Your local Dgraph instance and the lessons so far give you a sandbox for
experimentation. Run queries, add data, and modify the schema until the
material feels solid.

When you are ready, continue to [Data and More Data](/moredata/1) to work with
larger datasets and explore more of Dgraph's query language.
