There are three deletion options inside a delete mutation.

- `<uid> <edge> <uid>/"value" .` Delete a single triple (S P O)
- `<uid> <edge> * .` Delete all values for a given predicate (S P *)
- `<uid> * * .` Delete all predicates for a given node (S * *)

{{% notice note %}}
The `S * *` pattern only deletes predicates that are defined in the node's
`dgraph.type`. Untyped predicates remain untouched. See the
[DQL Mutation docs](https://docs.dgraph.io/dql/dql-mutation/) for details.

The examples given here are not complete. UIDs assigned on your instance would
be unique. Try something out; you're not going to hurt anyone, just delete their
friends.

You can do the same example using JSON format. You're able to do that through
our clients, cURL or Ratel UI.

#### See in JSON:

Delete all triples for a given node

```
 {
    "delete": [
        {
            "uid": "0xa"
        }
    ]
}
```

Delete all triples for a given edge

```
 {
    "delete": [
        {
            "uid": "0xa",
            "friends": null
        }
    ]
}
```

This doesn't delete their children which means in this case, it will not erase
the "friends". Only the relation would be deleted.

Deleting relations and then their children

```
 {
    "delete": [
        {
            "uid": "0x2", # Answer UID.
            "comment": {
                "uid": "0x3" # Delete relation (edge) with the Comment
        }
        },
        {
            "uid": "0x3" # Delete the actual comment
        }
    ]
}
```
