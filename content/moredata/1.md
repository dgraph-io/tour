Dgraph supports query aggregation, geo-queries, string querying, and more. To
explore these features we need a larger dataset.

### Load the movie dataset

In a terminal, navigate to the tour's root directory and run:

```
make seed-movie-dataset
```

On Windows (or without `make`), use Docker instead:

```
docker exec tour-seed make seed-movie-dataset
```

This loads about one million triples — movies, directors, and actors — into your
local Dgraph instance. Dgraph reports exactly how many triples it loaded and how
long the operation took.

One million triples gives us enough data for complex queries while keeping the
load time short.

The dataset is a subset of a
[larger movie collection](https://github.com/dgraph-io/dgraph-benchmarks/blob/main/data/21million.rdf.gz)
containing around 230,000 actors and 86,000 movies. Because it is a subset,
some actors or movies may be missing.

Later lessons may require you to check the indexes or schema types. You can
always run a [schema query](../../basic/3) or refer back to this page. Functions
at the query root require indexed predicates, and some functions require specific
index types.
