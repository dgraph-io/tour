Queries, schema types, and the visualization together reveal the structure of
the movies dataset.

The data supports multiple entry points: directors, movies, genres, and
locations each work as a starting node.

Start with directors. Kathryn Bigelow directed the early-90s classic *Point
Break*. The type schema tells us that a director (a `Person` type) has a `name`
and connects to movies through `director.film`.

Extend the query a level deeper by adding:

```
director.film (first: 1) {
    name
    initial_release_date
    genre { name }
    starring {
        expand(Performance) {
            uid
            expand(_all_)
        }
    }
 }
```

A movie has a `name`, plus `genre` and `starring` edges that lead to genre nodes
and performance nodes.

Follow the `starring` edge further: each node represents a single performance —
an actor playing a particular character in a movie.

Try the same queries starting with Tom Hanks. He is both an actor and a
director, so the results show performance links from both sides.

You can also query the full schema at any time:

```
schema {}
```

This returns every type and index in the database.

Explore further: with the techniques from the previous lessons you can find
every movie by a director, every movie featuring an actor, or the full cast of
a film.
