Aliases rename fields in the query output.

Aliases are useful when applying two different filters to the same edge. The
example query uses aliases to include the `friends` edge twice, each with a
unique set of arguments and fields.

**Something to try**: Query `People`, then select and alias the `xid` field as
`username` and alias the query as `users`. Then, query all people again, filtering
for just those with pets, and alias this query as `peopleWithPets`. See if you
can combine these queries into a single operation.

{
  users: queryPerson {
    username: xid
  }
  peopleWithPets: queryPerson(filter: { has: ownsPets }) {
    name
    pet: ownsPets {
      name
    }
  }
}
```
