Dgraph generates an `<edgeName>Aggregate` edge for every edge pointing to a
list. These aggregate edges, along with aggregate queries, let you count items
without returning every node.

Aggregate operations return a `<type>AggregateResult` type with fields for
count, minimum, maximum, average, and sum -- varying by schema type.

The example query requests every `PersonAggregateResult` field to return
aggregates from Alice's friends:

- `count` - count how many friends Alice has
- `xidMin` - find the minimum xid value sorted alphabetically
- `xidMax` - find the maximum xid value sorted alphabetically
- `nameMin` - find the minimum name value sorted alphabetically
- `nameMax` - find the maximum name value sorted alphabetically
- `ageMin` - find the minimum age of Alice's friends
- `ageMax` - find the maximum age of Alice's friends
- `ageAvg` - find the average age of Alice's friends
- `ageSum` - sum of all of the ages of Alice's friends

{{% notice "note" %}} `<field>Avg` averages only nodes that have the value set.
If you kept the data from the Introduction unchanged, Alice has six friends, but
only four have an age. The sum is 113 and the average across those four nodes is
28.25. {{% /notice %}}

To discover the available aggregate fields, try this introspection query:

```
{
  __type(name: "<type>AggregateResult") {
    name
    fields {
      name
    }
  }
}
```
