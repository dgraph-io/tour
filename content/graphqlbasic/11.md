The `has` filter finds nodes that have an outgoing edge or predicate value of
the given name.

The example query retrieves all people who have friends, then returns a count
of each person's friends.

**Something to try**: Query people that have friends and an age, and then count
their friends that have a set age.

    id
    name
    age
    friendsAggregate(filter: { has: age }) {
      count
    }
  }
}
```
