Data types and scalars determine how Dgraph stores and queries your data.

##### Type System

A GraphQL API is strictly typed. Every node must have a specific type. Dgraph's GraphQL API assigns types when you add data and supports filtering by type when you query.

You may have noticed from [Load Data]({{< relref "graphqlintro/4" >}}) that data in
triple format includes a `<dgraph.type>` predicate. These predicate values match
the GraphQL type definition of the node. If you load data using Bulk Loader,
Live Loader, or DQL mutations, you must set these type predicates for the node
to be accessible through the GraphQL API.

##### Data types and schema

The last query contained a subtle distinction: some fields returned values
(`name` and `age`), while others were edges to other nodes (`friend` and
`ownsPets`) with their own fields.

The GraphQL schema defines how to interpret every field. Run the example
introspection query and examine the JSON result.

A graph contains two kinds of fields: *nodes* and *values* (or *literals*). In
the example, person nodes have a `name` field with a `string` value and an `age`
field with an `int` value. They also have edges connecting to other nodes. A
value cannot have edges coming out of it.

Here are the types available to store values in Dgraph:

| Dgraph Type | Description |
|:------------|:--------|
|  `ID`       | Unique Identifier (UID) |
|  `Int`      | signed 32-bit integer |
|  `Int64`    | signed 64-bit integer |
|  `Float`    | double-precision floating-point number |
|  `String`   | string |
|  `Boolean`  | Boolean |
|  `DateTime` | RFC3339 time format with optional timezone like: 2006-01-02T15:04:05.999999999+10:00 or 2006-01-02T15:04:05.999999999 |
|  `Point`    | Geolocation types (see [docs](https://docs.dgraph.io/graphql/schema/types/#geolocation-types)) |
|  `PointList` | Geolocation types (see [docs](https://docs.dgraph.io/graphql/schema/types/#geolocation-types)) |
|  `Polygon`  | Geolocation types (see [docs](https://docs.dgraph.io/graphql/schema/types/#geolocation-types)) |
|  `MultiPolygon` | Geolocation types (see [docs](https://docs.dgraph.io/graphql/schema/types/#geolocation-types)) |

The schema declares that the `Person` type has a `friends` field pointing from one `Person` node to another -- not to a value.

Later sections cover schemas in depth ([see the schema module]({{< relref "schema/1" >}})). For now, you know enough to understand our graph's structure and the types of its nodes and values.
