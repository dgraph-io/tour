The last query returned data, but revealed little about graphs.

In Dgraph and GraphQL, queries return graphs, not tables or lists.

A query executes against a graph and returns a subset of it.

The next query returns Alice along with her network of friends. Run the query
to see the results.

The results include Alice's age but omit her friends' ages, because the query
requested `age` only for Alice, not for nodes on the `friends` edge.

**Something to try**: Alice also owns a pet, find it and its `name`. The
`ownsPets` edge can help you here.

    friends {
      name

    ownsPets {
