The `order` argument on edges and `query<Type>` functions sorts query results.

Ordering leaves the graph visualization unchanged but orders the JSON response
list.

The generated `<type>Order` input type accepts three arguments:

- `asc` -- sort by a field in ascending order
- `desc` -- sort by a field in descending order
- `then` -- add an additional sort argument

The example query retrieves all `Person` nodes sorted by `name` in ascending
order.

**Something to try**: Sort Alice's friends by their age, in descending order;
and then by their name, in ascending order.

{{% expandable %}}

```
{
  getPerson(xid: "alice") {
    id
    name
    friends(order: { desc: age, then: { asc: name } }) {
      id
      name
      age
    }
  }
}
```

_FYI, This query will fail on Dgraph versions prior to 21.03_
{{% /expandable %}}

Dgraph generates a list of orderable fields for every type. Edges to other
nodes cannot be ordered.

To discover available order fields, inspect the generated `<type>Orderable`
`enum`:

```
{
  __type(name: "PersonOrderable") {
    name
    enumValues {
      name
    }
  }
}
```
