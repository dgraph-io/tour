{{% notice "note" %}} These queries require the introduction steps: setting up
your backend, defining your schema, and inserting sample data. See the
[GraphQL tour introduction]({{< relref "intro/1" >}}). {{% /notice %}}

Here is a "hello world" query in GraphQL.

Each query has at least one named root function, and results carry matching
labels.

Dgraph generates these functions from your schema. The
[GraphQL tour introduction]({{< relref "intro/1" >}}) defined two types:
`Person` and `Animal`. For each type, Dgraph generates three queries --
`get<Type>`, `query<Type>`, and `aggregate<Type>` -- producing the following:

- `getPerson`
- `queryPerson`
- `aggregatePerson`
- `getAnimal`
- `queryAnimal`
- `aggregateAnimal`

`getPerson` and `getAnimal` require an identifier for a single node. If you
are new to graph databases, think of types as tables and nodes as rows.
`queryPerson` and `queryAnimal` return all nodes of that type by default; you
can filter, order, and paginate the results. `aggregatePerson` and
`aggregateAnimal` return aggregate calculations without returning nodes
themselves. The most common aggregate use case is counting nodes. Aggregate
queries accept a filter argument to aggregate a subset of nodes.

Dgraph assigns each node a unique internal identifier, its UID. The `ID` scalar
maps this UID to a schema field. Dgraph also supports external identifiers
(XIDs) through the `@id` directive. Our example schema maps the UID to the `id`
field and the XID to the `xid` field of each type. `query<Type>` queries need
neither identifier, but `get<Type>` queries require at least one. Because Dgraph
maps between UIDs and XIDs, `get<Type>` queries work with either field.

Select fields by listing them in your query. The example requests `id`, `xid`,
`name`, and `age`. Fields without a set value return `null`.

Run the example query to see the results.

The results use JSON format and mirror the query structure.

Something to try: Change the query to select a different person. Check the
[sample data](../../graphqlintro/4) for reference.

{{% expandable %}} Find an `xid` in the data, then try the following:

```
{
  getPerson(xid: "<XID here>") {
    id
    name
    age
  }
}
```

Or look at the UIDs in the responses and try the following:

```
{
  getPerson(id: "<UID here>") {
    xid
    name
    age
  }
}
```

Or, try to get an animal instead with the following:

```
{
  getAnimal(xid: "<XID here>") {
    id
    name
  }
}
```

You can edit these queries freely. Copy and paste any answer into the query
panel, then edit and run it. {{% /expandable %}}

The tutorial covers client-to-API connection later; focus on query syntax for
now.
