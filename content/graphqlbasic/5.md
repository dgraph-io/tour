Functions applied to outgoing edges filter nodes.

Previous queries filtered only top-level nodes using the `getPerson` function,
but you can apply filters to any edge in a query.

Dgraph provides many filter functions, including:

- `fieldName: { allofterms: "term1 ... termN" }`: matches nodes with an outgoing
  `string` field `fieldName` where the string contains all listed terms

- `fieldName: { anyofterms: "term1 ... termN" }`: As with `allOfTerms`, but
  matches at least one term

- The equalities and inequalities can be applied to edges of types: `Int`,
  `Int64`, `Float`, `String` and `DateTime`, including:

  - `fieldName: { eq: value }`: equal to
  - `fieldName: { ge: value }`: greater than or equal to
  - `fieldName: { le: value }`: less than or equal to
  - `fieldName: { gt: value }`: greater than
  - `fieldName: { lt: value }`: less than

You can also filter on regular expressions, full text search, or geographic
(geo) search.

These filter functions appear as arguments on fields in GraphQL syntax. Dgraph
generates these arguments only for fields with the proper `@search` directive
for indexing.

**Something to try**: You can query all people under the age of 30, along with
the name of their pets. (**Hint**: use a filter argument with the `queryPerson` root
function.)
