GraphQL query results are graphs, structured to mirror the query itself.

The braces in `<edge name> { ... }` define nested blocks. Edges inside a block
match nodes found by following the edge that begins the block.

Nesting continues as you follow edges from node to node. Indenting the query
improves readability.

Compare the JSON result to the query structure. The `friend` edge matched
several nodes, each represented in the JSON output.

**Something to try**: Query to get a list of Alice’s friends' pets, or Alice's friends'
friends.

{{% expandable %}} Query Alice's friends' pets:

```
{
  getPerson(xid: "alice") {
    id
    name
    friends {
      id
      name
      ownsPets {
        id
        name
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Query Alice's friends' friends:

```
{
  getPerson(xid: "alice") {
    id
    name
    friends {
      id
      name
      friends {
        id
        name
      }
    }
  }
}
```

These examples show that a query is a traversal through a graph, following edges
to the desired data. The IDs in the JSON output allow you to interpret the
result as a graph rather than a tree. Because the output forms a graph, the
query for Alice's friends' friends may contain cycles (repeated nodes).
