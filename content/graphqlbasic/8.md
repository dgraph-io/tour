Queries often return thousands of results. Paginate or limit large result sets
with the `first` and `offset` arguments:

- `first: N` Return only the first `N` results
- `offset: N` Skip the first `N` results

By default, query results order by `uid`. Override this by
[specifying an order]({{< relref "graphqlbasic/8" >}}).

`first` and `offset` work on `query<Type>` queries and on any edge to a list
of nodes.
