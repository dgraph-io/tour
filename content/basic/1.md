The examples in this section will not function correctly unless you have [added the schema](/intro/2) and [loaded the example data](/intro/3) in the DQL Introduction.

The query on the right is a basic DQL query.

Every query has a name. Here the name is `find_michael`, and the result carries the same label.

The search criterion `func: ...` matches nodes. The function `eq` matches nodes whose `name` equals "Michael". The result lists the matched nodes and their outgoing edges.

Dgraph assigns each node a unique internal identifier called a UID. You can return it in a query with `uid`, and you can retrieve a node directly with `func: uid(<uid-number>)`.

Run the query now, and examine the result.

Challenge: Modify the query to find Michael by his `uid`.

{{% expandable %}} 

First run the original `find_michael` query and note the `uid` in the response.     
```
{
  find_michael(func: eq(name, "Michael")) {
    uid
    name
    age
  }
}
```

Then modify the query to use the `uid` function as follows, replacing `UID_HERE`
with the unquoted `uid` value.

Michael's `uid` begins with `0x` and is 18 characters long (for example, `0xfffd8d67d98b46fc`). Each local Dgraph instance assigns its own UIDs.

```

{
  find_michael(func: uid(UID_HERE)) {
    uid
    name
    age
  }
}
```



You can edit the queries and try whatever you like. Copy any answer into the query panel, edit it, and run it.

This tutorial runs the query for you, so you can focus on the query text. To learn more about sending queries directly, see [posting queries](https://docs.dgraph.io/dgraph-overview/) or [programming with Dgraph](https://docs.dgraph.io/clients/).
