Queries often return thousands of results. To select the top-k answers,
paginate for display, or cap a large result set, use `first`, `offset`, and
`after` together with ordering.

- `first: N` Return the first `N` results
- `offset: N` Skip `N` results
- `after: uid` Return results that follow `uid`

The example query sorts Michael's friends alphabetically by name, skips the
first friend (`offset: 1`), and returns the next two (`first: 2`).

By default, Dgraph orders results by `uid`. You can override this by
[specifying an order]({{< relref "basic/8" >}}).

Use `after` when you know only the last `uid` returned and have not tracked how
many results you have already retrieved.
