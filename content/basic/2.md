The last query got us some data, but the result wasn’t very interesting, nor was
it much to do with graphs.

In Dgraph and DQL, queries return graphs, not tables or lists of data.

A query is executed against a graph and the result is a subset of the queried
graph, or some manipulation or calculation based on the queried graph.

Let’s improve the query to get Michael and his network of friends.

Challenge: Michael also owns a pet, find it and its `name`. A tip: the
`owns_pet` edge will help doing so.

{
  michaels_friends_and_pet(func: eq(name, "Michael")) {
    name
    age
    friend {
      name
    }
    owns_pet {
      name
    }
  }
}
```
