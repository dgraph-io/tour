Sort results with `orderasc` and `orderdesc`. Place either keyword as a parenthetical parameter on an edge, followed by the predicate to sort on -- for example, `friend (orderasc: age)`.

The example query finds Michael's friends and returns them sorted by age in ascending order. You can sort on any scalar predicate: `int`, `float`, `string`, or `date`. The graph visualization renders the same layout regardless of sort order, but the JSON response lists nodes in the sorted sequence.
