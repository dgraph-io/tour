Aliases rename edges and functions in the JSON output. Place the alias before a colon, followed by the edge or function it renames: `persons_name : name`.

In the example, `persons_name : name` renames the `name` edge to `persons_name` in the response,
and `number_of_friends : count(friend)` gives the count result a readable label. 

Aliases affect only the output — they do not change the stored data or the query logic.
