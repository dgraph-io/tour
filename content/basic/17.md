Dgraph supports facets — key value pairs on edges — as an extension to RDF
triples. Facets describe *aspects* of a relationship by adding properties to
*edges*, instead of *nodes*. For example, a `friend` edge can carry a boolean
`close` facet to mark close friendships.

In this lesson you will:

- Seed some facet data
- Query facets on scalar predicates
- Experiment with edges that carry multiple attributes

More details about facets are in the docs: https://docs.dgraph.io/dql/query/facets

If you run the query in `basic/17.txt` against the base tour dataset, it returns
no data because the sample dataset does not include facet values yet. Seed the
facet data first, then rerun the query.

### Seed the sample facet data

Run this mutation in your terminal before executing the query examples: {{% expandable %}}

```
curl -sH "Content-Type: application/rdf" "localhost:8080/mutate?commitNow=true" -XPOST -d $'
{
  set {

    # -- Facets on scalar predicates
    _:alice <name> "Alice" .
    _:alice <mobile> "040123456" (since=2006-01-02T15:04:05) .
    _:alice <car> "MA0123" (since=2006-02-02T13:01:09, first=true) .

    _:bob <name> "Bob" .
    _:bob <car> "MA0134" (since=2006-02-02T13:01:09) .

    _:charlie <name> "Charlie" .
    _:dave <name> "Dave" .


    # -- Facets on UID predicates
    _:alice <friend> _:bob (close=true, relative=false) .
    _:alice <friend> _:charlie (close=false, relative=true) .
    _:alice <friend> _:dave (close=true, relative=true) .


    # -- Facets for variable propagation
    _:movie1 <name> "Movie 1" .
    _:movie2 <name> "Movie 2" .
    _:movie3 <name> "Movie 3" .

    _:alice <rated> _:movie1 (rating=3) .
    _:alice <rated> _:movie2 (rating=2) .
    _:alice <rated> _:movie3 (rating=5) .

    _:bob <rated> _:movie1 (rating=5) .
    _:bob <rated> _:movie2 (rating=5) .
    _:bob <rated> _:movie3 (rating=5) .

    _:charlie <rated> _:movie1 (rating=2) .
    _:charlie <rated> _:movie2 (rating=5) .
    _:charlie <rated> _:movie3 (rating=1) .
  }
}' | python -m json.tool
```

{{% /expandable %}}

Then run the query in `basic/17.txt` to see facet values returned.

For JSON mutation with facets see: https://dgraph.io/docs/mutations/#facets

### Add multiple attributes to a single node

Sometimes you need two edges with distinct predicates pointing to the same node.
This pattern can be used to "explain the relationship" of nodes.

For a target node with UID `0x0f43`, set up the RDF like this:

```
_:MyNode <predicate1> <0x0f43> ( foo=bar, and=1 ) .
_:MyNode <predicate2> <0x0f43> ( bar=bar, and=2 ) .
_:MyNode <predicate3> <0x0f43> ( bar=bar, and=3 ) .
```

More examples: {{% expandable %}}

```
_:MyNode <Morning> <0x0f43> ( foo=true, and=1 , since=2006-02-02T13:01:09 ) .
_:MyNode <Evening> <0x0f43> ( bar=false, and=2, since=2006-02-02T13:01:09 ) .
_:MyNode <Night>   <0x22>   ( bar=true, and=3,  since=2006-02-02T13:01:09 ) .
```

{{% /expandable %}}

If you repeat the same predicate instead of distinct ones, each new line
overwrites the previous edge attribute. Use distinct predicates to preserve
each set of facet values.
