Dgraph supports facets — key value pairs on edges — as an extension to RDF
triples. Facets describe *aspects* of a relationship by adding properties to
*edges*, instead of *nodes*. They can also be used as weights for edges.

For example, a `friend` edge can carry a boolean `close` facet to mark close
friendships.

More details about facets are in the docs: https://docs.dgraph.io/dql/query/facets

We first need to seed our dataset with facet information so the example query returns data.
Copy and paste the command below into a terminal to run the mutation:

### Seed the sample facet data

```
curl -sH "Content-Type: application/rdf" "localhost:8080/mutate?commitNow=true" -XPOST -d $'
{
  set {

    # -- Facets on scalar predicates
    _:alice <name> "Alice" .
    _:alice <mobile> "040123456" (since=2006-01-02T15:04:05) .

### Adding multiple attributes to a single node

Sometimes you need two edges with distinct predicates pointing to the same node.
This pattern can be used to "explain the relationship" of nodes.

For a target node with UID `0x0f43`, set up the RDF like this:

```
_:MyNode <predicate1> <0x0f43> ( foo=bar, and=1 ) .
_:MyNode <predicate2> <0x0f43> ( bar=bar, and=2 ) .
_:MyNode <predicate3> <0x0f43> ( bar=bar, and=3 ) .
```

More examples: {{% expandable %}}

```
_:MyNode <Morning> <0x0f43> ( foo=true, and=1 , since=2006-02-02T13:01:09 ) .
_:MyNode <Evening> <0x0f43> ( bar=false, and=2, since=2006-02-02T13:01:09 ) .
_:MyNode <Night>   <0x22>   ( bar=true, and=3,  since=2006-02-02T13:01:09 ) .
```

If you repeat the same predicate instead of distinct ones, each new line
overwrites the previous edge attribute. Use distinct predicates to preserve
each set of facet values.
