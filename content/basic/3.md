It’s time to talk about data types and nodes.

## Type System

Starting in version 1.1, Dgraph has support for a type system. The type system is used to categorize nodes and query
them based on their type. The type system is also used during expand queries.

In order to expand or delete nodes, you need to define your types correctly.

## Data types and Schema

There was some magic in the last query because some of the queried edges
returned a value (`name` and `age`), but some were edges to other nodes
(`friend` and `owns_pet`) that themselves had further properties.

We need to consult the schema to tell us how to interpret any given edge.

The visualization won't be much use this time. Instead let's consider the schema we [added
in the intro section](/intro/2):

```
type Person {
    name
    age
    friend
    owns_pet
}

type Animal {
    name
}

name: string @index(term) @lang .
age: int @index(int) .
friend: [uid] @count .
owns_pet: [uid] .
```

There are two kinds of nodes in this schema, let's call them ***nodes*** and ***values*** (values are also sometimes called
***literals***). Nodes representing people `type Person` have a `name` edge to a
`string` value, and an `age` edge to an `int` value. They also have a `friend` edge with a `uid` type in order to connect them
with other people. 

- Edges are attached to nodes to connect them to both values and other nodes.
- Edges cannot be attached to values.

Here are the types you can use to store values in Dgraph.

| Dgraph Type | Description                                                                                                         |
| :---------- |:--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `default`   | default type (It is a neutral type)                                                                                 |
| `int`       | signed 64 bit integer                                                                                               |
| `float`     | double precision floating-point number                                                                              |
| `string`    | string                                                                                                              |
| `bool`      | boolean                                                                                                             |
| `dateTime`  | RFC3339 time format with optional timezone eg: 2006-01-02T15:04:05.999999999+10:00 or 2006-01-02T15:04:05.999999999 |
| `geo`       | geometries stored using [go-geom](https://github.com/twpayne/go-geom)                                               |
| `password`  | encrypted value                                                                                                     |
| `uid`       | a reference to a node                                                                                               |

Looking at the `friend` definition in the schema, we can tell that `friend` edges, by virtue of using the `uid` type (`friend: [uid] @count .`), are used to
connect nodes with other nodes - to connect a person with their friends.

The `name` definition, which uses the `string` type (`name: string @index(term) @lang .`), is attached as an edge to both the `Person` and `Animal` types 
to connect their nodes with their names. 

We'll cover more about schemas [later in the tutorial]({{< relref "schema/1" >}}), and there's much more to dive into in the [DQL Schema section of the docs](https://docs.dgraph.io/dql/dql-schema).
For now, though, we know more about the structure of our graph and the types of things in it.
