Every node in Dgraph belongs to a type, and every edge carries a data type.

## Type System

Dgraph's type system categorizes nodes and lets you query them by type. Expand queries also rely on types to determine which edges to return.

To expand or delete nodes correctly, define their types in the schema.

## Data types and Schema

In the last query, some edges returned values (`name` and `age`), while others pointed to further nodes (`friend` and `owns_pet`).

The schema defines what each edge means and what type of data it holds.

Run the schema query below, then compare the result with the schema we [added
in the intro section](/intro/2):

```
type Person {
    name
    age
    friend
    owns_pet
}

type Animal {
    name
}

name: string @index(term) @lang .
age: int @index(int) .
friend: [uid] @count .
owns_pet: [uid] .
```

This schema distinguishes two kinds of targets: ***nodes*** and ***values*** (also called ***literals***).

A `type Person` node has a `name` edge pointing to a `string` value and an `age` edge pointing to an `int` value. Its `friend` edge uses the `uid` type, connecting it to other person nodes.

- Edges are attached to nodes to connect them to both values and other nodes.
- Edges cannot be attached to values.

Dgraph supports the following value types.

| Dgraph Type | Description                                                                                                         |
| :---------- |:--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `default`   | default type (It is a neutral type)                                                                                 |
| `int`       | signed 64 bit integer                                                                                               |
| `float`     | double precision floating-point number                                                                              |
| `string`    | string                                                                                                              |
| `bool`      | boolean                                                                                                             |
| `dateTime`  | RFC3339 time format with optional timezone eg: 2006-01-02T15:04:05.999999999+10:00 or 2006-01-02T15:04:05.999999999 |
| `geo`       | geometries stored using [go-geom](https://github.com/twpayne/go-geom)                                               |
| `password`  | encrypted value                                                                                                     |
| `uid`       | a reference to a node                                                                                               |

The `friend` edge uses the `uid` type (`friend: [uid] @count .`), so it connects one person node to another.

The `name` edge uses the `string` type (`name: string @index(term) @lang .`) and appears on both `type Person` and `type Animal`, giving each node a human-readable label.

The [Schema section of this tutorial]({{< relref "schema/1" >}}) and the [DQL Schema docs](https://docs.dgraph.io/dql/dql-schema) cover schemas in full detail.
