The logical connectives `AND`, `OR`, and `NOT` combine multiple functions inside `@filter()`.

The example query finds Michael, then filters his friends to those whose age falls between 27 and 48 inclusive. `AND` requires both conditions to hold: `ge(age, 27) AND le(age, 48)` keeps only friends who satisfy both bounds. `OR` selects nodes that match either condition. `NOT` excludes nodes that match its condition.

Try changing `AND` to `OR`, or wrap one of the conditions in `NOT`, and run the query again to see how the results change.
