The `@cascade` directive keeps only nodes that have every edge requested in the
query. It also drops nodes whose nested filter matches nothing.

The first query below returns all of Michael's friends, whether or not they own
a pet.

```
{
  michael_friends_with_pets(func: allofterms(name@., "Michael")) {
    name
    age
    friend {
      name@.
      owns_pet
    }
  }
}
```

With `@cascade`, the result includes only friends who own a pet.

```
{
  michael_friends_with_pets(func: allofterms(name@., "Michael")) @cascade {
    name
    age
    friend {
      name@.
      owns_pet
    }
  }
}
```

For details, see the [`@cascade` directive documentation](https://docs.dgraph.io/dql/query/directive/cascade-directive).
