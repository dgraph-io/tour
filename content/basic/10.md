The `count` function returns the number of outgoing edges of a given name. In the example, `count(friend)` counts how many friends Michael has.

`count` can also appear at root inside `func:` to select nodes by edge count -- for example, `func: ge(count(friend), 2)` finds every node with at least two friends. 

Using `count` at root requires a `@count` index on the predicate.
