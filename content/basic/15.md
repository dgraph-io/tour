The `@normalize` directive

- returns only edges listed with an alias, and

- flattens the result to remove nesting


By adding the directive the example query returns only the aliased fields:
```
"michael_and_pet_name": [
  {
    "name": "Michael",
    "pet": "Rammy the sheep"
  }
]
```
Without it, the result would include unaliased fields like `age`, and has `pet` nested under `owns_pet`:
```
"michael_and_pet_name": [
  {
    "name": "Michael",
    "age": 39,
    "owns_pet": [
      { "pet": "Rammy the sheep" }
    ]
  }
]
```

Challenge: Modify the normalized query to include `age` in the result.
