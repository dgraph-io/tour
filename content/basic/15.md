The `@normalize` directive

- returns only edges listed with an alias, and

- flattens the result to remove nesting

By adding the `@normalize` directive to the query, the results remove the nested `owns_pet` block and drop `age`, returning only the aliased fields:
```
"michael_and_pet_name": [
  {
    "name": "Michael",
    "pet": "Rammy the sheep"
  }
]
```
Without it, the query would return:
```
"michael_and_pet_name": [
  {
    "name": "Michael",
    "age": 39,
    "owns_pet": [
      { "pet": "Rammy the sheep" }
    ]
  }
]
```

{{% notice tip %}} Aliased names can be the same as the original edge.
