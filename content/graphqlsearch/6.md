Full-text search works like a search engine: it factors in language, grammar, and
tense rather than matching terms literally. A search for "run" matches documents
containing "run", "running", and "ran".

Full-text search relies on two techniques:

- **Stemming**: reducing words to a common base so that differences in tense,
  number, or inflection do not prevent a match
- **Stop words**: removing common words such as "and", "or", and "it", along
  with other high-frequency words

Change `alloftext` to `allofterms` and note how the results differ.
