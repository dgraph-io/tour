Regular expressions require the `regexp` search directive, which applies a
trigram index. A trigram is a substring of three consecutive characters (runes).

The trigrams of "trigram" are: "tri", "rig", "igr", "gra" and "ram".

Dgraph converts a regular expression into a trigram query, searches the index
for possible matches, and then evaluates the full regular expression against
those candidates. At least one trigram must match.

Consider regular expression queries carefully. The more trigrams a query matches,
the more results Dgraph must check against the full expression, reducing
efficiency. Conversely, the more trigrams the expression enforces, the better
Dgraph uses the index, and the smaller the candidate set.

Efficient regular expressions use long substrings and minimize alternation.

An optional `i` may follow the final `/` to indicate case insensitive search.

The query below finds lines matching three consecutive uppercase characters.
