When Dgraph searches for strings, dates, or other values based on a filter,
it needs an index for efficiency. A [previous schema update](../../graphqlschema/3)
demonstrated how to specify indexes.

`Int`, `Float`, and `DateTime` have default indexes. `String` offers several
index types, and a single `String` predicate can use multiple indexes.

For `String`, the following indexes are available:

- `term`: filters by all or any listed terms; generates `allofterms` and
   `anyofterms`
- `exact`: matches a whole string and supports inequality; generates `lt` (<),
   `le` (<=), `eq` (=), `ge` (>=), `gt` (>), and `in` (not equal)
- `hash`: hashes the string for long-string equality; generates `eq` (equal) and
   `in` (not equal)
- `fulltext`: performs search-engine style matching; generates `alloftext` and
   `anyoftext`
- `regexp`: matches regular expressions; generates the `regexp` filter input

You specify multiple indexes as a list passed to the `by` argument of the
`@search` directive.

Push the schema mutation to create the new indexes and types. Dgraph may take a
moment to compute indexes on a larger data graph. Wait for the operation to
finish before continuing.
