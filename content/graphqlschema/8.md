Congratulations on completing the schema module.

Your running Dgraph instance serves as a sandbox. Experiment with queries and
mutations until you feel comfortable with the material.

The next module covers the search capabilities of Dgraph's generated GraphQL
API. After that, you can work with larger datasets in GraphQL before exploring
DQL, Dgraph's query language.
