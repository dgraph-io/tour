The schema update from the previous step created new *mutations* in the GraphQL
API. Use these mutations to add data. In GraphQL, changing the stored graph is
called mutating the data.

To load large amounts of data after updating a GraphQL schema, use the Live
Loader to add data as RDF triples. For an example of GraphQL data mapped to RDF
triples, see [Intro - Load Data](../../graphqlintro/4).

The current schema provides no way to uniquely identify a company. The best
available approach is to query companies and filter by industry:

```
{
  queryCompany(filter: { industry: { anyofterms: "Machinery Tech" } }) {
    name
    industry
    managers: employees(filter: { has: manages }) {
      id
      name
      employees: manages {
        id
        name
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Because the schema defines no unique identifier for `Company`, Dgraph does not
generate a `getCompany` query. Running the original mutation again creates
duplicate companies but not duplicate people, because `Person` has `xid` as a
unique identifier while `Company` lacks one.

Without a unique identifier for `Company`, you cannot update a `Person` to
reference a pre-existing company as their employer.
