As you saw in an [earlier lesson](../../graphqlintro/3/), Dgraph accepts a
GraphQL schema comprised of types to generate the GraphQL API.

The GraphQL API enforces strict types. You can only add and query data that
matches a predefined schema, but you can iterate on the schema at any time.

Most GraphQL implementations require you to define inputs, queries,
and mutations in the schema. Dgraph generates all of these from your type
definitions alone.

Every schema update must include the complete GraphQL schema. You still omit
inputs, queries, and mutations (Dgraph generates those), but if you leave out a
type, that part of the API disappears, even though the underlying data remains.

The example schema here builds on the previous schema by adding fields to the
`Person` type and introducing the `Company` type. This section explores these
changes and what a more complex schema enables.

Push this new schema to the server, and then continue to the next step.
