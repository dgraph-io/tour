The schema now includes bidirectional edges. These edges enable more advanced
queries against your database.

With balanced inverse relationships, you can query which company a person works
for and which employees work at a given company.

Bidirectional edges open up many application possibilities. This query finds who
works for "Company ABC" without extra edges, and in the same operation retrieves
Jack and his employers.

Inverse relationships show their full value at scale. With thousands of people
and companies, one-way relationships force inefficient queries.

A note on efficiency: repeated use of the `@cascade` directive can degrade query
performance. `@cascade` filters results after the query reads all matching nodes,
even those excluded from the response.

The following queries return the same nodes as the query in the editor, but less
efficiently because they rely repeatedly on `@cascade`.

```
{
  queryPerson @cascade(fields:["employers"]) {
    xid
    name
    employers(filter: { name: { eq: "CompanyABC" } }) @cascade(fields:["id"]) {
      id
      name
    }
  }
  queryCompany @cascade(fields:["employees"]) {
    id
    name
    employees @cascade(fields:["xid"]) {
      xid
      name
    }
  }
}
```

The query above uses parameterized cascade syntax to require only specific
fields.
