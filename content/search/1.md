Dgraph uses indexes to search strings, dates, and other values efficiently. You
specify indexes in a [schema mutation](../../moredata/1).

`int`, `float`, `geo`, and `date` have default indexes. `string` lets you choose
from several index types, and you can build multiple indexes for the same
`string` predicate.

For `string` the following indexes are available

- `term` (default) for use with `allofterms` and `anyofterms`
- `exact` for use with inequality - matching whole string
- `hash` as for `exact` but hashes string - useful with long strings
- `fulltext` for full text search with `alloftext` and `anyoftext`
- `trigram` for use with regular expressions

Specify multiple indexes as arguments to `@index`.

Apply the schema mutation to add the indexes to the movie data. It will take a
few minutes for Dgraph to compute those indexes for all the movie data. Let the
mutation run and move on once it's finished.

If Docker stops your Dgraph process during the mutation, increase Docker's
memory allowance, restart Dgraph, reload the
[initial schema and data](../../moredata/1), then apply this mutation again.
