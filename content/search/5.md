Full text search works the way Google searches web pages. It differs from term
matching by respecting language, grammar, and tense. For example, the search term
"run" matches documents containing "run," "running," and "ran."

Full text search uses two key techniques:

- stemming: reducing words to a common base so that differences in tense,
  plural/singular, or other inflection still match, and
- stop words: discarding words such as "and," "or," "it," and "maybe" that occur
  too often to be useful in a search.

Note the difference if `alloftext` is changed to `allofterms`.

<!---Full text search with `alloftext` removes the stop word AAA and matches BBB with BBBing.  While term searching with `allofterms` matches only strings that contain each word in the search.-->
